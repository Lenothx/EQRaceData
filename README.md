# EQRaceData
 Parses the Race Data into a Text File 


Place the racedata.txt and dbstr_us.txt file from your EQ Directory in and it will Parse both into a racedatacomplete.txt file

It will list out Race ID, Race Name (from DBStr), Race File (.s3d for earlier models, .eqg for later models), and an "Internal Name" such as "EQR_EARTH_ELEMENTAL_V3"

Current Example:
ID: 1 | Name: Human | File: HUM & HUF | Internal Name: EQR_HUMAN & EQR_HUMAN

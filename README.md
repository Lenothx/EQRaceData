# EQRaceData
 Parses the Race Data into a Text File 


Place the racedata.txt and dbstr_us.txt file from your EQ Directory in and it will Parse both into a racedatacomplete.txt file

With the January 20, 2021 Patch, Internal Name is no longer available, so newer files will not have this.

It will list out Race ID, Race Name (from DBStr), Race File (.s3d for earlier models, .eqg for later models), and (prior to 1/20/21) an "Internal Name" such as "EQR_EARTH_ELEMENTAL_V3"

Current Example:
ID: 1 | Name: Human | File: HUM & HUF

Pre 1/20/21 Example:
ID: 1 | Name: Human | File: HUM & HUF | Internal Name: EQR_HUMAN & EQR_HUMAN
